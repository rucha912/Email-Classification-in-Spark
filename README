# Project title: Email Classification using Naive Bayes Approach

Input:
We are using processed enron email data set for classification. 
Data set can be found at http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/
It contains alreadyed labelled spam and ham emails. 

Algorithm:
We have implemented two algorithms for classfication. Seperate python code files can be found for same. 
Logistic Regreesion: logistic_reg.py
Naive Bayes: naive_bayes.py

Framework:
Algorithms are implemented using Apache Spark Framework
Spark framwork: 1.0.6
Python version: 2.6
Libraries required: SparkContext, mllib,numpy,scipy etc. 

Execution:
1. Logistic Regression: spark-submit <source_code_path>
Input folders are hard coded into the source code.
There are emails at 'users/rkadam/enron1/spam' and 'users/rkadam/enron1/ham' on the dsba cluster
2. Naive Bayes:
   $ spark-submit <source_code_path> <input_folder_path>
* Here input folder follows structure:  'any_basic_path/train/ham/all_text_files.txt'
					'any_basic_path/train/spam/all_text_files.txt'
					'any_basic_path/test/ham/all_text_files.txt'
					'any_basic_path/test/spam/all_text_files.txt'

Output: 
Output is displayed on console which includes performance evaluation matrix.
